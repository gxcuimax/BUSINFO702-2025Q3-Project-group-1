Aligning YouTube Interests, Demographics, and E-Commerce: Multi-Source Analysis of U.S. Consumer Trends

ELT TRANSFORMATION-
The ELT process begins with data extraction, where raw demography, e-commerce, and YouTube datasets were imported into SQLite using the .import command. During the transformation stage, multiple data cleaning steps were applied: coded demographic variables (e.g., STATEFIP, REGION, METRO, SEX, RACE, MARST, CITIZEN, EDUC, EMPSTAT) were recoded into human-readable categories; YouTube categoryId values were mapped to descriptive labels, and trending_date was standardized into SQL DATE format; e-commerce order_date fields were reformatted into a consistent YYYY-MM-DD. In addition to recoding and standardization, new derived attributes were constructed to support warehouse analysis: the Time dimension was built with year, month, quarter, day, and weekday hierarchies; the Location dimension incorporated population-level aggregates and clean distributions of employment, race, marital status, citizenship, and education; the Product dimension summarized orders, sales, profit, quantity, and discounts by customer segment; and the YouTubeVideoTrend dimension introduced an engagement score (views + likes â€“ dislikes + comments) and top-ranked daily categories and videos. Finally, the Trend fact table integrated these dimensions, capturing aggregated sales, profit, orders, discounts, and YouTube engagement metrics. The SQL syntax is well-structured, correct, and reflects strong data modeling practice, ensuring the warehouse is consistent, interpretable, and analysis-ready.
